# ML-Projects-Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering
This **Machine Learning project** is based on **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**, an **unsupervised learning** technique. The dataset includes features such as **Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1–100)** to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. The **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)** values were calculated for different cluster numbers, and the **Elbow Method** was applied to find the optimal number of clusters. The clusters were **visualized using scatter plots**, particularly **Annual Income vs. Spending Score**, revealing clear customer groups. This project demonstrates ML’s capability in **market segmentation and business strategy optimization**.
